![mockup](images/mock-up.png)

The live website can be found [here]()

## Purpose

This Website was created for the sole purpose of completing the second Milestone Project for the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. It was built using the knowledge gained from the HTML, CSS, User Centric Design, JavaScript Fundamentals and Interactive Frontend Development modules. A full list of technologies used can be found in the [technologies](#Technologies-Used) section of this document.

This website was created to showcase my knowledge of HTML, CSS & JavaScript and to provide users with some entertainment in the form of a simple jumping/barrier dodging game (with a poltical theme) created with JavaScript. The game should be easy to understand, simple to interactive with and give feedback to the user on all inputs.

#### Site Goals:
* To showcase the skills I have learnt in HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
* To provide users with an interactive game to play.
* To create an enjoyable, interactive game that makes the user laugh at the end.
* To make some political commentary.
* To create a game that makes the user want to share the website with friends.
* To help reduce boredom in this hard times.

#### User stories
* As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site.
* As a user, I want to view the website and content clearly on any device.
* As a user, I want to be able to start a game when I am ready.
* As a user, I want feedback if I lose the game (hit a barrier).
* As a user, I want to know how far I got if I lose in the game.
* As a user, I want a way to restart the game when I lose.


#### Features planned:
* Ability to make Trump jump.
* Restart game button if you lose.
* The text in the barrier to change to a different scandal each time Trump jumps over one.
* Corresponding month and year for each scandal to appear in the game.
* A 'you lose' screen to appear informing the user how far they got when they lose.
* An impossible-to-jump-over final barrier labelled "Election 2020"
* A 'final' screen when the user inevitably hits the last barrier with the option to "contest results"
* A real final screen
